# Yang Wu's Portfolio

This is the first portfolio page I make for web developer job application. Comments and suggestions are welcome!

## Tech Stack
* HTML5 & CSS
* Bootstrap
* fullpage.js

## Next Step
As I am doing fulltime coding bootcamp and want to start job application as soon as I have enough projects to show, it is not very realistic to learn a new thing in days for making a portfolio page. However, I have planned to learn Next.js after graduating from bootcamp and use it to do my next version of portfolio!
